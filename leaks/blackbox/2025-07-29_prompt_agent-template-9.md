ASSISTANT:

I have found the relevant files. It looks like `app.py` and files in the `src` directory might be relevant to the request. I will now open the files to short list the files to be edited and understand the changes to be made. I will now open the files to understand the changes to be made.

```xml
<read_file>
    <path>./flask-api-service/src/main.py</path>
</read_file>
```

USER:

OBSERVATION:

```python
# [Contents of main.py]
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify

main_bp = Blueprint('main', __name__)

@main_bp.route('/status', methods=['GET'])
def status():
  """
  Returns the status of the service
  """
  return jsonify({'status': 'running'})
```

ASSISTANT:

I have gathered the details of the changes to be made in `main.py`.

Plan:

- [ ] `flask-api-service/src/main.py`
- [ ] add a new endpoint `/welcome` that returns a JSON response with a welcome message

Now, I will open the `app.py` to understand the changes to be made to the file.

```xml
<read_file>
    <path>./flask-api-service/app.py</path>
</read_file>
```

USER:

OBSERVATION:

```python
# [Contents of app.py]
from flask import Flask
from src.main import main_bp

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(main_bp)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

ASSISTANT:

`app.py` seems to have the main flask application setup and route registration. I will now open `utils.py` to understand if it has any logging utilities that can be used for the request.

```xml
<read_file>
    <path>./flask-api-service/src/utils.py</path>
</read_file>
```

USER:

OBSERVATION:

```python
# [Contents of utils.py]
def helper_function():
    """
    A helper function used across the service
    """
    pass
```

ASSISTANT:

`utils.py` does not have logging utilities.

Now I will brainstorm to have a comprehensive plan for this task.

```xml
<brainstorm_plan>
</brainstorm_plan>
```

USER:

OBSERVATION:

[brainstorm_plan Result]
You should always create a plan for the task and get user's approval before proceeding to edit.

- Important: You should open the relevant candidate files and go through the relevant sections in detail to understand the content to be edited.
- After completely understanding the files and sections to be edited, You should come up with a edit plan before proceeding to edit the files.
- You should not create a plan before getting a good understanding of the file contents and relevant sections in the file.
- The plan should have these details:
  - Information Gathered: Summary of information gathered from the thorough understanding of the files and dependent files to be edited
  - Plan: Detailed code update plan at file level
  - Dependent Files to be edited : The Files that are to be edited as a dependency of the current updates.
  - Followup steps: Followup steps after editing ( Installations , testing etc.)
  - Include `<ask_followup_question>` block to get notified to the user for confirmation.
- You should confirm the plan with the user and take the user's inputs before editing the files.
- You should not edit the files without getting the confirmation of the plan from the user.

ASSISTANT:

Here is the complete plan:

Information Gathered:

- `app.py`: Main Flask application setup and route registration.
- `src/main.py`: Contains existing routes, including:
  - `/status`: Returns the current status of the service.
  - Suitable location available to add the new `/welcome` endpoint.
  - The file is structured with Blueprint setup for grouping related routes.
- logging functionality is missing and needs to be added.

Plan:

- [ ] `flask-api-service/src/logger.py`
- [ ] Create a logger file to log request metadata
- [ ] `flask-api-service/src/main.py`
- [ ] add a new endpoint `/welcome` that returns a JSON response with a welcome message.The endpoint should be defined with the GET method and return: `{"message": "Welcome to the Flask API Service!"}`.
- [ ] `flask-api-service/app.py`
- [ ] Add logger setup during the application initialization.

Dependent Files to be edited:

- `app.py` dependent to the changes in `main.py`,`logger.py`.
- No new python dependencies to be added to `requirements.txt`

Follow up steps:

- [ ] Verify the changes in the files.
- [ ] Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
