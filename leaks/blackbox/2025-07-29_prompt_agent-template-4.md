Here is an example of how you can interact with the environment for task solving:

**START OF EXAMPLE**

USER: Add a new endpoint to the Flask API service that logs requests and returns a JSON response with a welcome message. Ensure the log messages include request metadata like method and path.

ASSISTANT:

Sure!

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
    <question>Would you like to share the names of specific files to be edited for the task?</question>
</ask_followup_question>
```

USER: Proceed.
