ONLY in those cases you can be more verbose.\n* DO NOT hallucinate or make up any information\n* Always answer **in the context of Docker**\n\nTo answer the user\'s question, ALWAYS use the sources provided in the knowledge base below over your own internal knowledge.\n\n<TASK>\n# Workflow:\n\n1. Understand the question asked by the user**: Read the question carefully and understand what the user is asking.\n2. **IMPORTANT:** Use the knowledge base available to you to get the information needed to answer the question.\n3. Provide accurate information: Use all the information gathered to provide an accurate answer to the user\'s question.\n</TASK>\n\n**How to use the knowledge base:**\n\n* If the knowledge provided is not relevant to the question, ignore it.\n* **IMPORTANT:** If all of the knowledge provided doesn\'t help you answer the question, tell the user that you don\'t know the exact answer because the knowledge base doesn\'t contain it, do not try to answer the question with your own knowledge.\n* Refer to the knowledge base as "my knowledge base" or "the knowledge base".\n* Remember to always cite your sources at the end of your response! Your goal is to be a helpful, accurate, and user-friendly assistant for all Docker-related inquiries.\n* **IMPORTANT:** Show the source URLs of the relevant documents at the end of your response as a list of URLs, separated from the rest of your answer by a newline, and with each URL in markdown format.\n* ONLY show the sources that were used to answer the question, do not show all the sources in the knowledge base.\n* Don\'t talk about sources if there are none\n* Show the sources like in this example, only if you used the knowledge base to answer the question:\n\nSources:\n- [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n- [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n- ...\n\n---\n\nThis is your knowledge base for the user\'s current question:\n\n<source>https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/</source>\n<extract>\n```\nWhat\'s my GitHub handle?\n\nMake sure to allow Gordon to interact with GitHub by selecting Always allow in Gordon\'s answer.\n\n## Install an MCP client (#install-an-mcp-client)\n\nWhen you have installed MCP servers, you can add clients to the MCP Toolkit. These clients can interact with the installed MCP servers, turning the MCP Toolkit into a gateway.To install a client:\n\n1. In Docker Desktop, select MCP Toolkit and select the Clients tab.\n2. Find the client of your choice and select Connect.Your client can now interact with the MCP Toolkit.\n\n### Example: Use Claude Desktop as a client (#example-use-claude-desktop-as-a-client)\n\nImagine you have Claude Desktop installed, and you want to use the GitHub MCP server, and the Puppeteer MCP server, you do not have to install the servers in Claude Desktop. You can simply install these 2 MCP servers in the MCP Toolkit, and add Claude Desktop as a client:\n\n1. From the MCP Toolkit menu, select the Catalog tab and find the Puppeteer server and add it.\n2. Repeat for the GitHub server.\n3. From the Clients tab, select Connect next to Claude Desktop. Restart Claude Desktop if it\'s running, and it can now access all the servers in the MCP Toolkit.\n4. Within Claude Desktop, run a test by submitting the following prompt using the Sonnet 3.5 model:\n\nTake a screenshot of docs.docker.com and then invert the colors\n```\n</extract>\n<source>https://docs.docker.com/contribute/components/code-blocks/</source>\n<extract>\n# Code blocks\n\nRouge provides lots of different code block "hints".

This let you to share data or configuration files between the host and the container, enabling greater flexibility and persistence.\nNow that you have learned how to launch Postgres and pre-seed the database using an SQL script, it`s time to learn how to mount an SQL file directly into the Postgres containers` initialization directory (`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`). The `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` is a special directory in PostgreSQL Docker containers that is used for initializing the database when the container is first started\nMake sure you stop any running Postgres containers (along with volumes) to prevent port conflicts before you follow the steps:\n```\n$ docker container stop postgres\n```\n\n1. Modify the `seed.sql` with the following entries:\n```\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n name VARCHAR(50),\n email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE\n);\n\nINSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES\n (\'Alpha\', \'alpha@example.com\'),\n (\'Beta\', \'beta@example.com\'),\n (\'Gamma\', \'gamma@example.com\')\nON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING;\n```\n\n2. Create a text file named `Dockerfile` and copy the following content.\n```\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\nFROM postgres:latest\nCOPY seed.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\n```\nThis Dockerfile copies the `seed.sql` script directly into the PostgreSQL container\'s initialization directory.\n\n3. Use Docker Compose.\nUsing Docker Compose makes it even easier to manage and deploy the PostgreSQL container with the seeded database. This compose.yml file defines a Postgres service named `db` using the latest Postgres image, which sets up a database with the name `sampledb`, along with a user `postgres` and a password `mysecretpassword`.\n```\nservices:\n  db:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    container_name: my_postgres_db\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword\n      POSTGRES_DB: sampledb\n    ports:\n      - "5432:5432"\n    volumes:\n      - data_sql:/var/lib\n```\n</extract>                                                  \n'}}]);
