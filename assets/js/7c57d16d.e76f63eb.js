The following are examples of how concise you should be with your answer:\n\nTo change the current working directory in Google Colab:\nUse code with caution\npython %cd sample_data\n\nTo import data from Google Sheets, you will first have to authenticate yourself.\nUse code with caution\npython from google.colab import auth auth.authenticate_user()\n\nNext, import the `gspread` library and initialize it with your credentials.\npython import gspread from google.auth import default creds, _ = default() gc = gspread.authorize(creds)\n\nFinally, open the desired sheet that you want.\nUse code with caution\npython worksheet = gc.open(\'Your spreadsheet name\').sheet1\n\nget_all_values gives a list of rows.\nrows = worksheet.get_all_values() print(rows)\n\nIf needed, you can also convert your data into a dataframe using `pandas`.\nUse code with caution\npython import pandas as pd pd.DataFrame.from_records(rows)\n\nThis is the end of the examples. Remember the rules I gave above when answering any subsequent questions I give next.\n'},89266:(e,t,n)=>{n.r(t),n.d(t,{assets:()=>h,contentTitle:()=>c,default:()=>p,frontMatter:()=>u,metadata:()=>o,toc:()=>d});const o=JSON.parse('{"id":"colab","title":"colab","description":"colab Prompt","source":"@site/docs/colab.mdx","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/colab","permalink":"/awesome-system-prompts/colab","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/EliFuzz/awesome-system-prompts/blob/main/docs/colab.mdx","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{"title":"colab","description":"colab Prompt","hide_table_of_contents":true},"sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","previous":{"title":"codex","permalink":"/awesome-system-prompts/codex"},"next":{"title":"cue","permalink":"/awesome-system-prompts/cue"}}');var a=n(47259),s=n(78828),r=n(45920),i=n(19754),l=n(65057);const u={title:"colab",description:"colab Prompt",hide_table_of_contents:!0},c=void 0,h={},d=[];function b(e){return(0,a.jsxs)(l.A,{queryString:"primary",children:[(0,a.jsx)(i.A,{value:"latest",label:"latest",children:(0,a.jsx)(l.A,{queryString:"secondary",children:(0,a.jsx)(i.A,{value:"2024-05-11 prompt",label:"2024-05-11 prompt",attributes:{className:"tabs__vertical"},children:(0,a.jsx)(r.A,{language:"text",children:n(80873).A})})})}),(0,a.jsx)(i.A,{value:"archived",label:"archived",children:(0,a.jsx)(l.A,{queryString:"secondary",children:(0,a.jsx)(i.A,{value:"2024-01-08 prompt-archived",label:"2024-01-08 prompt",attributes:{className:"tabs__vertical"},children:(0,a.jsx)(r.A,{language:"text",children:n(28690).A})})})})]})}function p(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(b,{...e})}):b()}}}]);
